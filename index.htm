<h4>motril</h4>

<p>la garnatilla is 8 km away from motril, the closest large town.</p>

<h4>key</h4>

<p>there are two sets of keys to the house.
one is with john and shirley, the other with gaby and fernando.
gaby and fernando are the next door neighbours, just below the house and to the right.
they have a car repair shop in torrenueva.
carmen may also have one set, but she now lives in motril with her daughter carmen so she can take care of her grandchild when her daughter goes to work, and just comes to garnatilla each weekend.
john and shirley live here all the time, in the house opposite carmen's. see below for <a href="#address">addresses</a>.</p>

<h4>renting a car</h4>

<p>i always reserved a car via internet, directly at malaga airport.
you can search in google for 'car hire malaga' or 'alquilar coche malaga'.
one place is called www.malagacar.com. you should be able to get one for about 15 euros per day if you rent it for 12 days.
update for october 2008: i rented one for 17 days for 180 euro plus 65 euros to pay for a full tank of petrol, to be returned empty.
2013: i rented one for 90 euro plus 70 euros for the full tank of petrol via internet.
they (<a href="http://www.delpasocarhire.com">www.delpasocarhire.com</a>) told me that if i call them directly instead of going through internet, i can return it empty instead, and the insurance will be included, not extra.</p>

<h4>beds, covers, mosquito netting</h4>

<p>there are three twin mattresses in the house.
there are also lots of sheets and towels and one or two blankets, but i would bring my own sheets as well to be sure you have something clean and pleasant.
if you can, please ask carmen to let you wash some of the stuff in her washing machine so that it stays fresh.</p>

<p>there may be mosquitoes in summertime.
a huge mosquito net is available for covering the bed.
to hang it over the bed, attach the four extra posts (2.5 meters tall) to the four corners of the bed.
hang the mosquito net over the four posts so that the bed is entirely covered.</p>

<p>when leaving, make sure that the mattresses and all the covers are well protected from moisture and dirt and insects.</p
>

<h4>weather and temperature</h4>

<p>i was there once for easter in april and it was pretty cold, especially in the mornings.
the house gets sun from the south and west, but not from the east, so the mornings are cool.
in the daytime, it will be at least 20-25 degrees in april.
i would take a set of long-sleeved or long-legged woolen underwear just in case, and normal summer clothes as well.
right now i am sitting here in october and the temperature is fine for shorts all around the clock.</p>

<h4>beach</h4>

<ul>
<li>playa de la joya, west of torre nueva</li>
<li>playa del cañuelo, east of herradura, after cerro gordo</li>
<li>calaiza, east of herradura, between herradura and cerrro gordo</li>
</ul>

<p>to get to the sea: from our house down to the sea is about 5 km on the field roads through the agricultural area, down to torre nueava, so it might take ten minutes to drive. in the roundabout in puntalon, head left instead of right rowards motril, and then turn right towards the sea after the bar. part of the roads are gravel. this avoids a detour of 8 km going to motril first.</p>

<p>the beach we visit most frequently is the nudist beach playa de la joya to the left of torre nueva, because it is very quick to reach, there are few people there, mostly less than ten, and it is quite clean. there are not many people because you have to walk a couple of minutes from the parking place to the beach, and go down a long flight of stairs. go through torre nueva westwards coming from motril or la garnatilla, exit the town on the west, go up the hill a few hundred meters, and turn right onto a little road on the right that leads directly to a little parking place beside the path and staircase leading to the beach.</p>

<p>another wonderful beach is el cañuelo, on the border between the provinces of granada and malaga, about 20 km west of motril. to get there, take the coast road N-340 from motril westward past almuñecar and la herradura, go through the tunnel through the cerro gordo, and directly afterwards there is a roundabout with a sign pointing down to the parking lot and the beach. here you have to walk for quite a while, maybe 20 minutes, down the hill to the beach. cerro gordo is a natural reserve, so you can often see mountain goats coming down the hill and even playing on the beach.</p>

<p>finally the most exclusive and smallest of all is calaiza, just after la herradura and just before the tunnel through cerro gordo. this is a very small beach, hard to reach, you have to leave the car and go on foot down a steep hill. there is hardly ever anyone there at all, and no official signs pointing it out either. morning sun. you can see it from the other side of la herradura, looking across the bay, below the new urbanizacion on the cerro gordo.</p>

<p>other less interesting and less lonely beaches, but more accessible, are in motril, salobreña, torre nueva, castell de ferro and calahonda.</p>

<h4>water, electricity and gas</h4>

<p>you have to switch on the water, electricity and gas when you arrive. just reverse the instructions at the end, for turning it all off when you leave.</p>

<h4>gas bottles</h4>

<p>there are three gas bottles in the house. you need two gas bottles, one for the water heater and one for the cooker. in winter, the third can be used for the portable gas heater. if one runs out, please get a refill immediately.  the refills are cheap, there is a truck that comes up to garnatilla with fresh bottles now and again, or you can take it down to motril yourself.</p>

<h4>connecting a gas bottle</h4>

<p>there is a gas cooking stove, gas water heater and a portable gas heater. they all need to connected to a gas bottle before use. the connection to the gas bottle is a round ressure valve that goes on top of the gas bottle. it is connected by placing it on top of the bottle, pushing it down hard, then pushing the black plastic ring at the bottom of the valve down at the same time. after that, it should be impossible to pull the valve off without pulling the black plastic ring up again first. after the valve has been connected with the bottle, you switch on the gas by flicking the little switch on top of the valve.</p>

<h4>switching off the gas when you go out</h4>

<p>you should always switch off all the gas bottles before leaving the house. do so by flicking the switch on top of the pressure valve off again.</p>

<h4>lighting the gas water heater</h4>

<p>the gas water heater needs to be switched on before it produces hot water. before lighting it, connect the gas bottle and switch on the gas. the heater has two knobs and one push button. the top knob controls the gas flow, the bottom one the water temperature. the push button is for making a spark to switch on the pilot flame. turn the top knob all the way clockwise, until it points to three o'clock. this is the 'off' setting. turn the top knob counter-clockwise from three o'clock to eleven o'clock. now you can hear the gas escaping when you push it in hard. this is the setting for lighting the pilot flame. keep the top knob pushed in hard and click the push button repeatedly to light the pilot flame. you see a little spark produced each time you click. it may take a few clicks before the pilot flame actually catches fire. if you find it hard to light the pilot flame with the spark, you can also simply use a normal match instead. when it does, keep the top knob pushed in hard and wait for ten seconds. then turn the top knob further counter-clockwise from eleven o'clock to six o'clock and you are done.</p>

<h4>bathroom</h4>

<p>i suggest opening the top windows in the bathroom as well as the one above the washbasin. in summer you can open them completely and leave them open, the glass paret as well, to get lots of air. in wintertime i would open the shutters only, to keep out the wind but let in lots of light.</p>

<h4>fridge</h4>

<p>the freezing compartment at the top of the fridge lacks a door to close it. block it with a piece of cardboard or something, otherwise the fridge will continue running all the time and almost freeze everything you put in. defrost occasionally, for instance by simply pulling the plug but leaving the fridge closed in the evening, then pouring out the water from the container and plugging in again in the morning.</p>

<h4>internet</h4>

<p>there is a wireless internet connection available in la garnatilla itself. you can get a password from shirley by becoming a member in the neighbours association for a year at a cost of ca. 30 euros. alternatively, you can go to the library in motril for a fast free wireless hot spot internet access there. look for the biblioteca central, c/ marquesa de esquilache, casa de la palma, which also houses the uned, universidad national de education a distancia, close to al campo, or alternatively one the agencia de lecturas, for instance no 3, jose lopez rubio, rambla de capuchinos, near the antigua comisariat, which is on the side of motril closer to la garnatilla. the access requires a code, and the last one known to me is motril bibliotheca 1357986420900.</p>

<h4>shopping</h4>

<p>al campo is big and horrible and expensive but has everything. mercadona is closer and has a lot as well. the nice little shops and the closed market place in motril are best and most fun. the nicest coffee i know of is to be had from a little shop selling cafes sol y crema in motril centre, locally roasted. there is a market opposite the mercadona on tuesdays and fridays.</p>

<h3>departure checklist</h3>

<p>before you leave, do not forget the five important things: <b>clean</b> up, switch off <b>gas</b>, <b>electricity</b> and <b>water</b>, and <b>lock up</b>:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you turned off the street light next to the house, turn it on again.</li>

<li>clean up all the floors, clean and put away the dishes and cutlery, clean the oven, turn off, clean and open the fridge, disconnect it by pulling the plug out of the wall.
make sure the fridge door stays open, hang the cable between the door and the body.</li>

<li>disconnect all gas bottles completely, i.e. remove the connections. that means disconnecting the pressure valve from the top of the bottle.</li>

<li>turn off the water completely, i.e. with the central tap outside in front of the house.
it is in a metal box marked "Llave de Paso".
the key for the box for the tap is hanging behind the kitchen door.
the other little keys on the ring are for the wood fire baking oven beside the house.
please lock the box and put back the key afterwards.</li>

<li>turn off the central electricity completely.
the electricity meter is beside the main door.
there is a black up-and-down main switch beside the meter.
switch that off, and then pull out the fuse (a white ceramic thing with a wire screwed into it)
and put it on top of the meter.</li>

<li>lock the main door from the inside and then the kitchen door from the outside using the key, and give the key back to whomever you got it from, carmen or shirley or fernando and gaby.</li>
</ul>
